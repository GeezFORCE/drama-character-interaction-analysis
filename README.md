# Drama Character Interaction Analysis

- Project work for the course Text Technology

> **_The project is still a work in progress with the processor part just finishing up._**

## What is the project about?

- Dramas from earlier centuries can be hard to follow.
- They’re filled with archaic language and references long-lost to time.
- This often breaks the flow of the story and makes it difficult to grasp how characters relate to one another.
- But what if we could visualize those relationships instead?
- What if we could visualize which characters interact with one another?
- That’s what this project is about, turning complex, classical drama into a clear visualization of character
  interaction.

## Project Structure

- The project is organized as a monorepo with currently 3 different modules
- The `common` module contains the common utilities used across the project
- The `scraper` module contains the code related to the scraper
- The `processor` module contains code related to the processor
- The `api/` directory is the root directory storing the collection files for a popult REST API client
  called [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com) which we use for testing

## How to run the code

> As a pre-requisite, please have Java (preferably JDK v 21) and maven installed

> 💡 If you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, open the code as a project simplifying it

- Make sure you are at the root directory
- Run `mvn compile` or `mvn package` to compile the project
- For running each application, run their respective jars.
- Here is an example for the scraper module

```shell
java -jar scraper/target/scraper.jar
```

- This will bring up the scraper
- Similarly, one can bring up the processor module as well

> 💡 You can know if the services are up using the health endpoint
> `curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8080/health`
> Refer the port mappings in [How to test the code section](#how-to-test-the-code)

## Bringing up eXist-DB

> As a pre-requisite, please have Docker installed

- We have packaged eXist-DB into a docker-compose service
- To bring up the database, execute the following command

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

- If you get an error
  `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/user1/.docker/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`,
  please ensure docker is up and running

- Please note that it will take some time for the DB to be up and running, please run the following command and verify
  the mentioned log appears

```shell
docker logs exist-db
```

```shell

```

## How to test the code

> It will be easier if you have [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com) installed
> You can also use other API clients like `Postman` or even `curl` from the command line

- Open the folder `api` in bruno to view the collection

- Following are the port mappings for the services

| Service   | Port |
|-----------|------|
| eXist-DB  | 8080 |
| Scraper   | 8081 |
| Processor | 8082 |

- Once the services and the database is up and running, perform a REST API POST request to `/load/all` endpoint of the
  scraper to start the process.
- You can verify the data insertion using RESTful API provided by eXist-DB as
  documented [here](https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/devguide_rest)

> 💡 Some handy sample data is provided in the directory `samples` if you want to explore the data
